		<abstract>Variability in historic faunal assemblages is believed to be related to niche
      construction effects associated with the establishment and cultivation of Old World
      domesticated flora and fauna in the New World. Fort Shirley, a French and Indian War period
      fortification in Central Pennsylvania occupied during the mid 1750's, is an important case
      study in this picture as it was occupied during the introduction of domestic livestock to
      Central Pennsylvania. Published zooarchaeological analyses of historic fortifications
      elsewhere in the New World highlight significant contributions of locally abundant wild fauna
      to military diets. Statistical comparison of faunal assemblages from military installations
      dating to the French and Indian War (1754-1763), including Fort Shirley, the American
      Revolutionary War (1775-1783), and the War of 1812 (1812-1815) will test the hypothesis that
      diet breadth narrowed through time and was accompanied by increasing reliance on Old World
      domesticates.</abstract>
